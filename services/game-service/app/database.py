# Infrastructure layer — database connection.
#
# This file is responsible for:
# - Creating the SQLAlchemy engine from DATABASE_URL (read from .env)
# - Defining the declarative Base that all ORM models inherit from
# - Providing get_db(), a FastAPI dependency that opens a session per request
#   and closes it when the request is done (using yield)
#
# Nothing in this file knows about Users, Games, or any business concept.
# It is pure infrastructure.
#
# See the README for the full implementation.
