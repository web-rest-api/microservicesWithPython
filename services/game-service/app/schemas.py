# Application layer — Pydantic DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
#
# This file defines the shapes of data coming IN and going OUT of the API.
# It is separate from models.py on purpose: the API shape is not always
# the same as the database shape (e.g. password comes in, never goes out).
#
# This file should define:
# - UserCreate  — fields accepted when creating a user (includes plain password)
# - UserOut     — fields returned to the caller (no password, ever)
# - UserList    — paginated envelope: { items, total, limit, offset }
#
# Use model_config = {"from_attributes": True} on UserOut so Pydantic can
# read directly from SQLAlchemy ORM objects.
#
# See the README for the full implementation.
